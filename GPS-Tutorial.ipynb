    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has two objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "- On the one hand, it is intended as an introduction to satellite navigation using the *Global Positioning System* (GPS). The programming of a *Software Defined Radio* (SDR) is used to demonstrate how the radio signals sent by the GPS satellites can be received and processed. For this purpose, the description is structured in the style of an *interactive tutorial* with short explanations and code examples.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- On the other hand, the text shall serve as documentation of a Python program for real-time GPS tracking. The code is developed and commented on the basis of many examples and then integrated as Python classes into the scripts. The final program for real-time positioning and tracking has been published separately on Github: [https://github.com/annappo/GPS-SDR-Receiver](#https://github.com/annappo/GPS-SDR-Receiver).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is aimed in particular at people who\n",
    "\n",
    "- want to acquire theoretical and practical knowledge of satellite navigation,\n",
    "- prefer *learning by doing* to better understand abstract concepts,\n",
    "- would like to carry out GPS tracking in real-time based on an SDR,\n",
    "- enjoy programming of devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrumental basis is a low-budget USB stick that was originally developed for the reception of radio programs and television via DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial). Its main function is to receive radio signals at an adjustable frequency, digitize them and then transfer the data to a computer via the USB interface. All subsequent steps, in particular the decoding of the information contained in the data, are performed by a computer instead of using analog electronic components of a conventional radio. This approach is known as *Software Defined Radio* (SDR). A USB stick based on an RTL2832U chip (RTL-SDR) can be used to receive signals from GPS satellites though this was not originally intended. Further technical information and first steps for its use can be found in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Python* programming language is used for data processing. It is characterized by modern design, free availability of powerful modules and quick learnability. With *JupyterLab*, an ideal environment is available for developing clear code and integrating it into the tutorial. For beginners, help on installing the software is provided in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of the tutorial is on a step-by-step development of an efficient Python code for measuring and decoding GPS data. The mathematical treatment is limited to the bare essentials in order to keep the text simple and make it easy for beginners to get started. Nevertheless, it is sometimes unavoidable to use advanced methods such as complex numbers and Fourier transforms. For introductions to these methods and more comprehensive treatments of GPS navigation, please refer to the mathematical appendix and the references at the end of the tutorial."

    "## GPS navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite positioning began in the 1960s, initially exclusively for military purposes.$^1$ The *Global Positioning System* (GPS) known today was developed in the USA from 1973 and its operational readiness (initially with 24 satellites) was announced for civilian purposes in 1995. From the year 2000, the GPS system, as available today, was released with an accuracy in the meter range, which led to a steep increase in its use, e.g. for navigation in vehicles. Nowadays, a corresponding electronic chip can be found in almost all smartphones and many (sports) watches. Compared to earlier methods of navigation based on time and latitude measurement,$^2$ the *absolute* accuracy that can be achieved for determining one's own location is incredibly good. As with other highly developed electronic devices, the given availability can be used without having to know the physical and technical background. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will explain in detail how this astonishing precision for determining the coordinates of any location on earth is possible. However, the focus is not so much on a general description of the system, as there are many good descriptions of this (see [References](#References)). Rather, it is intended to serve as a guide for determining the location yourself using easily accessible devices and software.\n",

    "#### Navigation principle \n",
    "The classic method for measuring the coordinates of a location in geodesy (land surveying) relies on the determination of triangles. It is based on the fact that only three dimensions of a triangle must be given for the unambiguous determination of all its properties.$^1$ We assume that the location to be determined is $X$ and forms a triangle with the already surveyed locations $A$ and $B$. With the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, their mutual distance $\\overline{AB}$ is also known, so that only two further quantities have to be measured. These can be, for example, two angles of the triangle or the two distances $\\overline{AX}$ and $\\overline{BX}$. This provides sufficient information to fix the position of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surveying with satellites is somewhat more complex because their locations are not in a given plane, but the information required is similar: the locations $A$, $B$ and $C$ of three satellites must be known and their distances $l_a$, $l_b$ and $l_c$ from the location $X$ are measured (trilateration). To illustrate this, you can imagine that the location $X$ is usually given by the intersection of the three spherical surfaces with the centers in $A$, $B$ and $C$ and radii $l_a$, $l_b$ and $l_c$.$^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "The better the satellite locations and the measured distances are known, the more accurately the location $X$ can be determined. Or vice versa: both the satellite locations and their distances to the location $X$ must be known to better than $\\pm 1\\,\\rm m$ if you want to determine the coordinates of $X$ within $\\pm 1\\,\\rm m$ accuracy.$^3$ With a typical distance to the satellites of over $20000\\,\\rm km$ and an average satellite speed of $v_b \\simeq 4\\,\\rm km/s$, this hardly seems possible with \"simple\" means. How can it be done?\n",

    "#### Pseudorange \n",
    "Very precisely synchronized clocks on the satellites are an important prerequisite for determining their distances to the location $X$. At the same point in time $t_0$ all satellites transmit electromagnetic signals which, due to the finite speed of light of $c \\simeq 299792.458\\,\\rm km/s$, reach the location $X$ with a delay at times $t_a$,$t_b$ and $t_c$ depending on the distances $l_a$, $l_b$ and $l_c$:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\n",
    "t_a = t_0+l_a/c\\,; \\quad t_b = t_0+l_b/c \\,; \\quad t_c = t_0+l_c/c \\ .\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The average transit time of the signals is around $80\\,\\rm ms$. If a synchronized clock is also available at the location $X$ and the time of transmission $t_0$ is known, the distances $l_i$ to the satellites can be easily calculated from the reception times $t_i$, $i\\in \\{a,b,c\\},$ measured at location $X$ (so-called *pseudo-distances* or *pseudorange*):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l_i = c\\cdot(t_i - t_0) \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the spatial coordinates of a location $X$ shall be determined to a precision of $\\Delta x \\le 1\\,\\rm m$, the required accuracy $\\Delta t$ of the clocks must be at least\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta t = \\Delta x/c \\le 3.3\\cdot 10^{-9}\\,{\\rm s} = 3.3\\,\\rm ns \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such high accuracy, which must be maintained over a long period of time due to the required synchronization, can only be achieved with atomic clocks, i.e. with complex, expensive technology. Atomic clocks are therefore an essential component of all GPS satellites. With a conventional GPS receiver, however, this effort cannot be made, so the deviation of its time from that of the satellites is undefined. In other words, the receiver does not know the exact transmission time $t_0$ for its clock, so it cannot deduce the pseudo-distances from its measured times $t'_a$, $t'_b$ and $t'_c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of $t_0$, however, an additional piece of information can be used as a workaround. This usually is the known position of another satellite $D$ and its reception time $t'_d$.$^1$ The *measured time intervals* $t'_b-t'_a$, $t'_c-t'_a$ and $t'_d-t'_a$ can then be used to determine the position of $X$ as they are independent of $t_0$ and the accuracy of a high-quality quartz timer is sufficient for time intervals of $\\le 20\\,\\rm ms$. $^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**We conclude:** To determine the coordinates of $X$ for a point in time $t_0$ to better than $\\Delta x \\simeq 1\\,\\rm m$, a) the positions of at least 4 satellites must be known with a precision better than $1\\,\\rm m$ and b) the reception times must be measured with an accuracy of $\\Delta t\\le 3.3\\,\\rm ns$.\n",

    "1. *Alternatively, if known, the geographical altitude $h$ of the location $X$ can also be used as additional information.*\n",
    "2. *Compared to the previous geometric interpretation, the time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry here. Each TDOA corresponds to a hyperboloid of revolution and the receiver is located at the point where the hyperboloids intersect ([Wikipedia, GPS - User-satellite geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#User-satellite_geometry)).*"

    "The distances from the location $X$ to the satellites are greater than $20000\\,\\rm km$ and the satellite's orbital velocity is almost $v_b=4\\,\\rm km/s$.  How can you then know the satellite locations for a given time $t=t_0$ with an accuracy of 1 m?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the satellite positions are measured as a function of time with the utmost precision using radar and laser measuring equipment at appropriately equipped ground stations. On the basis of the laws of physics, the elliptical orbits can then be described completely with just a few numbers (parameters) due to the frictionless movement in space. However, due to the required accuracy, even the smallest disturbances, e.g. due to the inhomogeneous mass distribution of the Earth's body, lead to intolerable deviations after a few hours. The orbital data is therefore updated regularly (~ 2 h) in order to maintain the required precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can the receiver at location $X$ obtain these orbit parameters? The elegant solution is that the orbit data is uploaded from the ground stations to the satellites by radio link and the satellites then regularly broadcast their own orbit values as digital data together with the time signals (see [Data reception](#Data-reception)).

    "#### Satellite signals: Gold code and correlation\n",
    "Since, as described, the satellites all send their time signals at exactly the same point in time $t_0$, the question arises as to how the signals can be assigned to the individual satellites in the receiver. A conventional method of differentiation would be to give each satellite its own transmission frequency. However, each satellite would then require its own tuner in the receiver, which would mean a considerable amount of additional electronic work. It is therefore preferable if all satellites use the same carrier frequency and their signals are superimposed in the same data stream after receiption by the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key trick to separating the data is that each satellite transmits a repeating signal sequence that uniquely identifies it - a so-called [Gold code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_code).$^{1,2}$ This consists of a fixed sequence of 1023 so-called *chips* characteristic of the satellite: a non-periodic sequence of binary pulses that (in the satellite's rest system) has an exact temporal length of $1\\,\\rm ms$. This sequence is called [C/A code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals) (coarse/acquisition code) in GPS parlance.$^3$ The special feature of the Gold codes is that the overlapping codes of different satellites cancel each other out except for a (pseudo-) random noise. They are *orthogonal* to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data of a specific satellite is \"fished out\" of the entire data stream by multiplying it with the satellite's own Gold code. The correct alignment in time for the multiplication (phase adjustment) is determined beforehand using a *correlation* calculation. This method serves as a kind of *pattern recognition* for the specific Gold code in the data stream.\n",

We estimate the magnitude of the temporal change as follows: During its orbit of $12\\,\\rm h$, a satellite is at best visible to the receiver for about $6\\,\\rm h$. If it appears on the horizon, it moves towards the receiver and then has a maximum Doppler frequency of $+5\\,\\rm kHz$. If, on the other hand, it disappears after $6\\,\\rm h$, the minimum possible frequency is $-5\\,\\rm kHz$.

    "#### Isolation and demodulation of satellite signals\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of the method described, two important pieces of information are finally available for a satellite $S_n$:\n",
    "- the Doppler frequency $f_{\\rm n}$ and\n",
    "- the shift $\\tau_n$ (code phase) of the C/A code in the data $D_{\\rm n}$ regarding the beginning of the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another variable that is required later for decoding the data is the *phase offset* $\\phi_n$ of the Doppler oscillation. However, this can only be determined after the satellite signal $D_n$ has been isolated, as it is hidden in the data channels $I$ and $Q$.$^{1}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe the situation in more detail: Let $V$ be the set of all (visible) satellites that have generated signals in $D_{\\rm all}$. With $n\\in V$, $D_n$ is the signal of a satellite $S_{\\rm n}$ and $f_n$ is its Doppler frequency, \n",

    "To decode the data in $A_{\\rm n}$, an array $G_{\\rm n,rep}$ of the same length as $H_{\\rm n}(t)$ is generated, which consists of repeating C/A codes $G_{\\rm n}$. To align with the C/A codes of the data in $A_{\\rm n}$, $G_{\\rm n,rep}$ is shifted in time by $\\tau_n$, resulting in $G_{\\rm n,rep}^\\tau$.\n",

In contrast to $G_{\\rm n,rep}^\\tau$, the C/A codes in $A_{\\rm n}$ exist in two forms, normal and inverted (highlighted in gray). Multiplication of superimposed C/A codes therefore generates either $+1$ or $-1$ for all *chips* contained in $G_{\\rm n}$. If we multiply $G_{\\rm n,rep}^\\tau$ and $A_{\\rm n}$ with each other, then the same signal $+1$ or $-1$ is generated for the temporal length of a C/A code of $1\\,\\rm ms$. The resulting sequence of binary pulses then corresponds to the binary code being searched for, however it is still given as a digitized analog signal $P_{\\rm n}(t)$,\n",

Here, multiplication by $G_{\\rm n,rep}^\\tau$ only produce *pseudo-noise*, as the C/A codes in the $A_{\\rm m}$ do not coincide with $G_{\\rm n}$. However, due to the large number of satellites, the average amplitude of this noise may be greater than $P_{\\rm n}$. In addition, there is thermal noise and unwanted signals from external sources. Therefore, the information $P_{\\rm n}$ in $H^\\prime_{\\rm n}$ is initially completely hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "To uncover $P_{\\rm n}$, it is now used that over a length of a C/A code all values are equal, either +1 or -1. The mean value over this length therefore is also +1 or -1. In contrast, the mean value of the noise contributions over the same length is close to zero. Since the averaging leads to a considerable reduction of the noise amplitude, the signal-to-noise ratio is much improved for most satellites. Furthermore, after replacing the 2048 samples of a C/A code by their mean value, a significant reduction in the amount of data is obtained. One complex sample value now represents the temporal length of a C/A code of $1\\,\\rm ms$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script below performs the corresponding data processing for the measurement data already used before. The results are shown over time periods of $128\\,\\rm ms$ each, which is equivalent to a data length of complex numbers of 128$\\cdot$2048 samples. As compared to the previous script, the function *decodeData()* is added. Here the data are first multiplied by the C/A codes shifted by $\\tau_n$ and then averaged as described.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the correlation diagram, the real and imaginary parts of the data signal are displayed in a second plot. The sliders below the plots are used to optimize the result. Their value range is small to allow a precise setting of the variables. The Doppler frequency, for example, must be found with an accuracy of around 1 Hz. The satellite signal to be investigated can be specified by the global variable *satNo* at the beginning of the script. The variable *codePhase* should be set to the value for $\\tau_n$ found with the correlation.$^3$ The phase offset $\\phi_{\\rm n}$ of the Doppler signal can also be changed using the slider. This changes the proportions of the data signal for the real and imaginary parts. It should be set such that the signal in the imaginary part is vanishing. Then the amplitude you are looking for is located undivided in the real part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a state of the data channels $I$ and $Q$ is ideal for evaluating the coded information. As a reference for a later discussion in chapter *Noise analysis*, it is noted here that in the case of a good signal, the *signal-to-noise ratio* $S/N$ for the real part alone is typically given by $S/N \\simeq 10$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function $P(t)$, which has steep edges, is cancelled by the division. Hence, if the phase were a constant, time-independent number $\\phi_{\\rm n}$, it could be easily calculated. However, the phase is closely linked to the demodulation of $f_{\\rm n}$, and since this is only partly successful and the Doppler frequency $f_n$ also grows slowly in time (see [Doppler effect](#Doppler-effect)), an amplitude modulation with a low frequency $\\Delta f$ usually remains. Therefore, the phase typically varies linearly with time $t$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(t) = \\phi_{\\rm n} + 2\\pi \\Delta f\\cdot t \\ .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be illustrated using again the previous script. After setting the parameter *SHOW_PHASE_PLOT = True* a third plot with the phase $\\phi(t)$ appears in the output. The slider for the phase offset $\\phi_{\\rm n}$ shifts the plot on the y-axis by the selected value. The Doppler frequency $f_{\\rm n}$ can be almost perfectly determined by trial and error with the condition that the amplitude $P(t)$ is a series of binary pulses and the phase is constant except for the noise. With the slider for the phase offset $\\phi_{\\rm n}$ you can then adjust the phase curve $\\phi(t)$ to be close to zero. The imaginary part $Q(t)$ is then also zero and the desired signal $P(t)$ is completely in the real part $I(t)$. If you then increase the frequency $f$ again with the slider in small steps, the phase $\\phi(t)$ grows linearly with an ever-increasing slope up to $90^\\circ$, whereupon it jumps suddenly to $-90^\\circ$. The greater the frequency deviation $\\Delta f$, the more jumps appear in the curve. The sign of $\\Delta f$ can be derived from the direction of the jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measured time course of $\\phi(t)$ is therefore well suited for correcting the deviation $\\Delta f = f-f_{\\rm n}$ from the actual Doppler frequency $f_{\\rm n}$. However, a curve shape for $\\phi(t)$ without jumps would be preferable. The jumps are a consequence of the periodicity of the trigonometric functions - the calculation of the argument with the inverse function *arctan* is not unique because $n\\cdot\\pi$ ,$\\,n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, can always be added. To obtain a reconstruction of the linear response, we use an algorithm based on the assumption that phase jumps above a certain noise threshold $\\Delta\\phi_s$ do not occur in the real signal. It requires, however, that the signal in $P(t)$ is significantly greater than its noise.\n",
    "\n",

In control engineering, such a process is called a (here negative) *feedback*. The aim is to adapt an *actual* output of a process variable (*PV*) to a desired value or *setpoint* (*SP*). The deviation or *error* between *SP* and *PV* serves as measure for the correction of *control variables*. The greater the error, the greater the correction for the control variables must be.

The code phase value for the sharp correlation peak changes slowly in time dependent on the current doppler frequency. In other words: the length in time of the C/A code (receiver time) is longer or shorter than 1 ms (satellite time) due to the speed of the satellite. However, in two events the correlation maximum does not change its phase continously but jumps over a large range to another position. This is caused by an error and explained below. \n",

In a few cycles $T_{\\rm cyc}$, the Doppler frequency $f_{\\rm n}$ is then found with sufficient accuracy using the control loop - this (dynamic) state is referred to as *phase-locked*.

If, for example, a $60\\,\\rm ms$ long positive amplitude is found, followed by a $40\\,\\rm ms$ negative amplitude, then the logical bit sequence $11100$ or $00011$ is encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The translation of the edge signals into a bit sequence can therefore be achieved simply by calculating the temporal distances between the edges using the satellite time. This is done in the Python code within the routine *evalEdges()* using the function *logicalBits()*. An array *bits* is returned with the numbers $\\pm 1$ as logical quantities. The receiver time *SMP_TIME* of the edge signals is stored in a second array *bitsSmpTime*. This array is needed later to link the begin of a subframe, its preamble, with its receive time. \n",

    "The bit sequence is then examined with regard to the desired subframe data. However, each data stream of length $T_{\\rm cyc}=32\\,\\rm ms$ contains just 1 data bit. To decode a complete subframe of 300 bits, at least $6\\,\\rm s$ of data length, i.e. 188 data streams, are required.

    "Finally, the bits are evaluated using the *evalGPSBits()* function. Here two central tasks with regard to the transferred bits are performed. First, the *preamble* is searched for in the bitstream. The preamble is located at the beginning of each subframe and is defined by a specific bit pattern. It is found by calculating the correlation between the bit data and the preamble pattern. As there can also be random matches, it must be checked for each one whether it really is the start of a subframe. To do this, the data is passed to an *Extract()* routine, starting with the preamble pattern. This checks the data and returns the decoded subframe data in case of no errors.\n",

The structures, variables and data it contains are based on the corresponding information in the [*GPS signal specifications*](https://www.gps.gov/technical/ps/1995-SPS-signal-specification.pdf). Knowledge of this document is therefore essential for understanding the code of this class. However, it is sufficient to mention here that the data bits also contain parity bits for error control, which are checked with the *checkParity()* function of *Subframe*. Therefore, if bits in the stream are faulty due to interference or a poor signal-to-noise ratio, these are usually detected. If the decoding was successful, the data is returned in a *Dictionary*. The reception time *ST* of the subframe is also included in it. \n",

    "**Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "A *frame* consists of 1500 bits that take 30 s to transmit (transmission rate $50\\,\\rm bit/s$). Each frame includes 5 equally long *subframes* of 6 s each. The subframes each contain 10 *words* of 30 bits each. Each *word* has six parity bits for error detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Five subframes with *identifiers* (IDs) 1 to 5 are sent repeatedly. The first two *words* (*telemetry word*, TLM, and *hand over word*, HOW) are common to all subframes and contain the preamble, the *time of week* (TOW) and the *identifier* (ID). TOW can be used to calculate the *exact* transmission time of the *next* subframe (leading edge of the first preamble bit) in seconds since the beginning of the week.$^{1,2}$ It is crucial for the positioning that all satellites send the subframes at nominally the same times. Small deviations, for example due to device-specific signal delays in the transmitter, are taken into account later using correction parameters that are also transmitted. The corrected preamble times serve as *exact time references* for all subsequent measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Subframe 1**, the *week number* is sent in addition to the *time of week*, which can be used to calculate the current date. The other parameters essentially concern correction values for the time. **Subframes 2 and 3**, on the other hand, contain the numerical values required to calculate the satellite positions, i.e. the orbital parameters of their elliptical orbit and correction values for the next few hours. These are collectively referred to as *ephemeris*. With **Subframes 4 and 5** the ephemerides of all satellites (almanac) are sent continuously so that the receiver is able to select the best satellites for fixing its position at any time. In contrast to the first three subframes, their content changes a total of 25 times due to the large size of the almanac, so that it is only fully transmitted after $12.5\\,\\rm min$. In addition, **Subframe 4** provides parameters for correcting changing propagation delays of the electromagnetic waves in the ionosphere.$^3$ However, these effects are currently not taken into account in this tutorial. Since no use is made of the almanac here either, the data sent with subframes 4 and 5 are largely ignored - only the time references are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the time references, the time corrections and the orbital parameters of the satellites, including corrections, are needed to fix the receiver position. This requires reading subframes 1, 2 and 3 at least once. This means that the receiver position can only be determined after $18\\,\\rm s$ of measurement time at the earliest if this information is not already available from another source.$^4$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Class SatData()**\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the subframes, the collected data is passed to an instance of the *SatData()* class (defined in *gpslib*) using the *readFrame()* function. This uses an instance of the class *Subframe()* to check and decode the data (see chapter *Digitization*). The data required later is stored as an instance variable in the dictionairy *ephemData*. The parameters IODC (*Issue of Data, Clock*) and IODE (*Issue of Data, Ephemeris*) are used to check whether the data is still up to date. If an update is signaled, the old data is saved and replaced by the new data.$^5$ The time references are saved as a tuple *(TOW,ST)* in the array *timeData*. If a complete set of required parameters is available, this is communicated by *readFrame()* with the return value of *ephemOk*.\n",

The required calculation steps are described in detail in the GPS specifications. To give an impression of the underlying physics, these are briefly referred to and commented on here. The time at which the position is to be determined is passed to the algorithm as the GPS time $t_0$ in integer multiples of $1\\,\\rm ms$.

In addition, the relativistic correction $\\Delta t_{\\rm r}$ of the time due to the elliptical orbit of the satellite is taken into account (see discussion in [Error sources and corrections](#Error-sources-and-corrections)).

After 20000 streams of $32\\,\\rm ms$ length, i.e. after a period of $t = 640\\,\\rm s$, the additional distance is $\\Delta s = 27443.2\\,\\rm m$ and the change in the code phase is $\\Delta t = 91.5\\,\\rm \\mu s \\simeq 187\\,T_{\\rm s}$. Both changes, with regard to $v$ and $a$, must be taken into account if the value for the code phase is to be predicted over a longer period of time. Later these numbers are used to determine whether a change of the code phase is caused by the movement of the satellite or is the result of an error induced by a delayed data processing (see [Real-time positioning](#Real-time-positioning))."

Instead, if the time of signal transmission $t_0$ of two satellites is identical, the difference between the reception times of these signals is taken, $\\Delta t_{12} = t_1 - t_2$.

    "#### Code phase interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it should be remembered how the sample time ST is measured. The code phase is central to this, as it contains the temporal shift of the C/A codes in fractions of a microsecond. For a data stream $H_{\\rm n}$, the correlation function $C_n(\\tau)$ is calculated using the C/A code $G_{\\rm n}$ of the satellite,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_n(\\tau) = G_{\\rm n}\\star H_{\\rm n} = \\int G_{\\rm n}^\\ast(t) H_{\\rm n}(t+\\tau)\\,{\\rm d}t \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired code phase is given by the value $\\tau=\\tau_{\\rm n}$ at which the correlation has its maximum, $C_{n,\\rm max} = C_n(\\tau_n)$. As $H_{\\rm n}$ is built from repeating C/A codes, it is sufficient if $H_{\\rm n}$ has the same length as $G_{\\rm n}$. For measurements with the RTL-SDR, this length is given by 2048 samples (CODE_SAMPLES=2048). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, several correlations of consecutive C/A codes are calculated and then averaged. Averaging over 8 correlations has proven to be a good compromise between the noise suppression achieved and the computational effort (CORR_AVG = 8). It should be noted, however, that the code phase slightly changes within the corresponding period of $8\\,\\rm ms$ (at maximum $25\\,\\rm ns$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the digitization in discrete time steps, the measured value for the code phase is necessarily an integer multiple of the sample period $T_{\\rm S} \\simeq 0.49\\,\\rm \\mu s$. The real delay, however, is a value that changes continuously with time, so that the real correlation maximum is located somewhere between two adjacent sample points. Its value can be approximately calculated through interpolation if the shape of the correlation function near the maximum is known. In the idealized case of two $n$ times oversampled C/A codes the correlation produces a triangular function of width $n$ (FWHM, Full Width at Half Maximum). In our case, this would suggest performing the interpolation with a triangular function of width $n=2$. However, due to the low-pass filtering applied to the signal before (down-)sampling the data,$^1$ the sharp edges of the C/A codes are more or less softened and the correlation maximum is rounded off to some extent. So instead of using a triangular shape for interpolation, a parabola might be a better choice. In the following both cases are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For interpolation, only the measured maximum value and its two neighboring values are taken into account, since only these are significantly above the noise level. The three values ​​uniquely define both a second degree polynomial and a symmetric triangular function, and after a fit both functions pass exactly through the given points. The following script shows the principle: Three random numerical values are generated with maximum in the middle and a parabola and a symmetric triangular function are fitted to them. The dashed lines indicate the interpolated maxima of the fits. \n",

The limits of the plot, however, are considerably smaller. With a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 15.1\\,\\rm m$ the uncertainty has been reduced by more than a factor of $5$. You can also try out other combinations of satellites by changing the values of *SAT0* and *SAT1* in the notebook.\n",

    "From the previous examples, you could get the impression that you can only obtain one measured code phase value per subframe (every $6\\,\\rm s$). But this is wrong. If a valid time reference is obtained with the successful reading of a subframe, then in principle the code phase of each subsequent C/A code can serve as a new reception time measurement, as its transmission time can be determined in units of ms by counting the C/A codes after the time reference. The limit is therefore one measured value per millisecond. However, the computing effort is probably too high for real-time measurements using Python. In contrast, fixing the position once per cycle time $T_{\\rm cyc}=32\\,\\rm ms$ is much easier to implement, as the code phase has to be determined for each cycle anyway to continuously track phase and frequency. \n",

    "#### Evaluation of the code phases\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter demonstrates, among other things, how a large number of code phases can be efficiently evaluated to calculate the pseudo-distances. Before that, however, two important aspects of their measurement have to be discussed in more detail. These concern a) the handling of different values of the code phases in a data stream, and b) their limited range of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up to this point, the same code phases $\\tau_n$, which were evaluated for demodulation and decoding,$^1$ were also used to calculate the pseudo distances. For each data stream read in, consisting of 32 C/A codes, the code phase was determined by calculating and averaging the correlation of 8 data blocks with a specific Gold code. For the calculation of the pseudo-distances it was assumed without explicit mention that the code phase $\\tau_n$ is representative for *all* C/A codes of the stream. In fact, it is true that the code phases of neighboring codes only differ by an amount that is below the estimated measurement accuracy. This difference can be easily determined: The temporal change of the code phase is a direct consequence of the Doppler shift and amounts to a maximum of $3.2\\,\\rm \\mu s/s$, so that the maximum difference of neighboring C/A codes is calculated as $\\Delta\\tau_{\\rm max} = 3.2\\,\\rm ns$. Expressed as a change in distance to a satellite, this corresponds to $0.95\\,\\rm m$.$^2$ However, this difference grows linearly with the mutual distance of two C/A codes within the stream and then has a much greater influence on the accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"figures/codePhaseMeas.png\" width = '800'/>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  To illustrate this let us suppose that the first pseudorange calculation is done at the reference time defined by the preamble. The position *p* of the corresponding C/A code in relation to the measured code phase is completely random and different for each satellite. For a position at the end of the stream ($p=16$), an error in the pseudo-distance of $p\\cdot 0.95\\,{\\rm m} = 15.2\\,{\\rm m}$ is possible. As the subsequent calculations of the pseudoranges are performed at a period of 32 ms (once per stream), the position *p* in the following streams remains constant over a long time.$^3$ As a result, the difference of the real code phase value at position *p* and the measured value in the center of the stream can lead to a significant systematic error of $15\\,\\rm m$. To approximately correct this error, the almost constant rate of change $\\Delta \\tau_n$ is measured and averaged over many streams, and the code phase $\\tau_{n,p}$ at position *p* is then estimated by\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\tau_{n,p} = \\tau_n + p\\cdot \\Delta \\tau_n \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interpolated code phase $\\tau_n$ can only have values in the interval $[-0.5,2047.5]$ if measured in units of $T_{\\rm S}$. If the maximum value is exceeded, it appears to jump to the minimum (and vice versa). However, for the time signal received every ms this jump means that it moves on to the following C/A code (or the previous one). These overflows (underflows) must be included when counting the number of C/A codes as measure for the time distance in ms from the given time reference. If, as here, a list of measured code phases is available, it is much easier to compensate for the jump by adding or subtracting $2048$ for all subsequent code phase values. In other words: the code phase curve as a function of time is made continuous. The skipped millisecond is then added or subtracted from the signal time by applying the corrected code phase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, the script for calculating the pseudo-distance is extended to demonstrate the new evaluation of the code phases. In contrast to the previous method, the time reference (TOW, ST) for each satellite is set only once with identical TOW values for both satellites (just for simplification). As before, the subframes and the code phases are loaded from JSON files. The following steps are then carried out for both satellites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code phases are corrected with regard to their restricted value range (overflow)\n",
    "- The *SatData()* instance reads the subframes to create the ephemeris table\n",
    "- The time reference (TOW,ST) is specified.\n",
    "- The integer code phase is removed from ST for replacement with the interpolated code phases CP.\n",
    "- The stream number ST_SNO is calculated from the ST value\n",
    "- The following operations are performed for all tuples (CP,SNO) of code phases CP and stream number SNO:\n",
    "    - The code phase CP is corrected regarding its position within the data stream\n",
    "    - The time difference (satellite time) to the reference in integer multiples of a ms is ${\\rm DT = (SNO - ST\\_SNO)}\\cdot T_{\\rm cyc}$\n",
    "    - Satellite position and time correction $\\Delta t_{\\rm sv}$ are calculated with the *SatPos()* instance for the GPS time (TOW,DT)\n",
    "    - Satellite distance $l_i$ to the receiver position is calculated\n",
    "    - Reception time in seconds is calculated with $t_i = {\\rm (ST + CP)/SMP\\_RATE + DT} + \\Delta t_{\\rm sv}$ \n",
    "    - Result is saved in a list as a tuple (DT, $l_i$, $t_i$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the residues $\\Delta l_{12} - c\\Delta t_{12}$ for equal DT values of the satellites are calculated and displayed in a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "1. *see [Determination of the Doppler frequency](#Determination-of-the-Doppler-frequency)*\n",
    "2. *The same result is immediately obtained by multiplying the maximum satellite speed $950\\,\\rm m/s$ by $1\\,{\\rm ms}$.*\n",

    "The main cause for the scattering of the values is based on the measurement uncertainty of the code phases. This can be shown by fitting the time-dependent curves of the code phases (see figure on the right) with a polynomial and then calculating the standard deviations of the measured values from the smooth best-fit curves. The calculation is done in the script above for both code phase curves using the function *getStdDev()*. The results are $\\sigma_0 = 6.3\\,\\rm m$ (or $0.043\\cdot T_S$) and $\\sigma_1 = 11.5\\,\\rm m$ (or $0.079\\cdot T_S$). According to error propagation the total error for the subtraction is then  $\\sigma_{\\rm tot} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_0^2+\\sigma_1^2} = 13.1\\,\\rm m$ which agrees perfectly with the value of the histogram. The values of the satellite positions are also subject to random errors, but these are comparatively small with a standard deviation of around $1\\,\\rm m$, so they do not play a role here.\n",

You can calculate that yourself for any combination of available satellites by changing the variables SAT0 an SAT1 in the script. The sometimes large and sometimes small deviations are due to a number of systematic errors that can add up or compensate for each other (see next chapter). \n",

With radius $R$ and angular velocity $\\Omega$ of the Earth, a receiver at latitude $\\vartheta$ has a speed of $v = \\Omega R\\cos\\vartheta$ and thus changes its position within $\\Delta t$ by a shift of $v \\Delta t$. For example, if the receiver is located at latitude $\\vartheta = 50^\\circ$, its position will shift in the easterly direction within a typical transit time of $\\Delta t\\simeq 80\\,\\rm ms$ by\n",

The satellite PRN22 is also located at the horizon, but in the northeast, i.e. in the opposite direction. Therefore its pseudo-distance is decreased by $20\\,\\rm m$. To correct the error for the deviation of actual distance (for $t_0$) and pseudo-distance (for $t_0+\\Delta t$), we can simply calculate the actual distance for the time $t_0+\\Delta t$ by adding the shift $\\Delta s$ to the receiver's position.

According to the special and general theory of relativity, two physical quantities are responsible for this: the strengths of the gravitational field $\\Phi$ at the positions of the clocks and the velocities $v$ of the clocks. For a fictitious observer at the center of the Earth$^2$ with a clock measuring a time duration ${\\rm d}t$ between the events, the corresponding time duration ${\\rm d}\\tau$ measured by a clock at a location at distance $r$ from the center is approximately given by $^3$\n",

This has little influence on the accuracy of the positioning, as only differences in the pseudo-distances are included and these only change by around $1\\,\\rm cm$ within the propagation time. On the other hand, the GPS time is then no longer synchronized with the normal time and the time references must be adjusted. Therefore, a different approach is chosen and the frequencies of the atomic clocks on the satellites are changed such that the time signals received on Earth (without Doppler effect) correspond exactly to the UTC time.

In the mathematical appendix [Relativistic correction term](#Relativistic-correction-term), it is derived elementarily for interested readers using the formulas given for time dilation and elliptical orbits. For readers who are less familiar with methods of differential calculus, it is confirmed here again numerically in a script. To do this, Kepler's equation$^6$ for calculating $E$ as a function of time is first solved for an elliptical orbit with eccentricity $e$ and major semi-axis $a$. This gives the distance $r(t)$ to the focal point of the ellipse (Earth); the orbital velocity $v(t)$ is determined from the conservation of energy and angular momentum. The quantities are inserted into the formulas for time dilation and numerically integrated. Finally, the difference is calculated from the mean value, the correction of which is already known. The plot shows a very good agreement between the numerical solution (blue) and the given formula (orange) for a typical eccentricity of $e=0.01$.$^7$ The largest time shift is about $\\Delta t = 20\\,\\rm ns$, which corresponds to a change in pseudo-distance of $\\Delta l =6\\,\\rm m$. The GPS specifications state that eccentricities of up to $0.03$ are possible. This makes it obvious that corrections to the relativistic time dilation are essential for absolute positioning accuracy in the meter range. \n",

It is further assumed that the value of the cycle time $T_{\\rm cyc}$ is a power of two (in ms). We specify, as in the previous script, that the transmission times $t_{n,k}$ and $t_{m,l}$ of the signals to be used are given by the satellite's reference time plus integer multiples of $T_{\\rm cyc}$, i.e.\n",

    "#### Least squares approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "With a sufficient number of known satellite positions and measured pseudoranges, it is possible to calculate the current position of the receiver. For each of the $m$ satellites there is an equation with four unknowns: the three Cartesian coordinates $e_x$, $e_y$ and $e_z$ of the receiver as well as the unknown transmission time $t_0$ on the non-synchronized receiver clock. To solve a system of equations with four unknowns, at least four determining equations are required, which is why data from at least four satellites is usually needed. However, it is generally better to observe more than four satellites, as in many cases the measurement uncertainty of the pseudo-distances for a certain direction produces much greater fluctuations than perpendicular to it - the point cloud of many position determinations is an ellipsoid with axes of different lengths. This is mostly the result of an unfavorable constellation of the observed satellites. If, for example, they are all low on the horizon, the measured propagation times change only slightly with the height of the receiver, so that the measurement uncertainties of the pseudo-distances in this direction result in a much larger standard deviation. This effect is known as *dilution of precision* (DOP). Due to the measurement errors, it is therefore advantageous to calculate the receiver position with an *overdetermined* system of equations $m > 4$. This is usually done in such a way that the result of an individual equation depend only on the uncertainties and is ideally zero. A *least squares method* is then used to vary the *free parameters*, i.e. $(t_0,e_x,e_y,e_z)$, in such a way that the sum of the error squares of all equations is minimized.\n",

The error is caused by the fact that the calculated positions of the satellites and the measured pseudo-distances do not apply to the same time due to the propagation time of the signals. There are various ways to correct this. The simplest approach is to first calculate the position without any correction and then *turn back* the Earth for the mean propagation time found. The remaining error of this approximation is at most in the range of a few meters and usually negligible compared to other systematic errors. On the other hand, correct consideration is not much more complex and thus avoids unnecessary uncertainties. \n",

    "The previous discussion suggests that the result could be further improved if the number of calculated positions within 1 sec were increased - a doubling of $N$ decreases the uncertainty of the mean values by a factor of $1/\\sqrt 2 \\simeq 0.71$. Such a doubling can be achieved in the code by changing the cycle time from $T_{\\rm cyc}=32\\,\\rm ms$ to $16\\,\\rm ms$ which is equivalent to $\\rm N\\_CYC=16$.

Therefore, it strongly depends on the used computer whether lower values of $T_{\\rm cyc}$ than $32\\,\\rm ms$ are reasonable for real-time tracking. The following computational costs resulted from runtime measurements using saved data with a maximum of 10 satellites as input for the real-time code decribed below (see [Real-time tracking](#Real-time-tracking)):\n",

    "\n",
    "It is reasonable to assume that the main source of noise in the measurements with the RTL-SDR is thermal noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signal-to-noise ratio \n",
    "\n",
    "It is known from the GPS signal specifications$^4$ that the power of the transmitted GPS carrier signal on the surface of the Earth is $-158\\,\\rm dBw$ to $-160\\,\\rm dBw$. This means that the carrier power is *below* the thermal noise power at the bandwidth of $2\\,\\rm MHz$ required for the measurement! Only by subsequently reducing the bandwidth to $1\\,\\rm kHz$ by averaging over the length of C/A codes (see *[Data reception](#Data-reception)*) does the noise drop to such an extent that it is approx. $16\\,\\rm dB$ below the signal level. This value refers to the total noise power, i.e. to $I$ and $Q$ channel together (magnitude of complex values). If the amplitude signal is only present in the $I$ channel, then the signal in the $Q$ channel corresponds to the phase noise. The noise power in the $I$ channel is half the total noise power, so the signal-to-noise ratio of the amplitude in the $I$ channel is $19\\,\\rm dB$. This corresponds to the noise power according to the sampling theorem for the bandwidth $\\Delta f = f_S/2$ with sample rate $f_S$ if only one channel is measured (real instead of complex values). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter *[Phase Locked Loop](#Phase-Locked-Loop)*, the amplitude of the demodulated signal was measured at $0.04\\,\\rm a.\\!u.$ and the S/N ratio in the $I$ channel was determined at $S_N \\simeq 10$, which corresponds to $20\\,\\rm dB$.$^5$ The deviation from the value calculated above with regard to thermal noise is therefore only $1\\,\\rm dB$. The good agreement proves that the measured noise power can actually be regarded as thermal. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of further noise sources, however, one would have expected a greater value for the measurement than that of the thermal noise, as this represents the absolute minimum. One possible reason for the underestimation is the inadequate numerical method used to calculate the power here. Estimating the power density of a continuous function of time $c(t)$ based on discrete sample values $c_k$ of a short time interval is actually not a trivial matter.$^6$ A better estimate than averaging over time can be made, for example, with the method of Welch$^7$, which is based on the averaging of power spectra using a window function in the Fourier transform. This can be tried out in the script for *frequency analysis* - it shows that the Welch method actually produces a larger estimation than time averaging or the equivalent Bartlett method (without window function). \n",
    "\n",

Either existing measurement data from a file or real-time data from individual satellites, as in the previous section, was used for evaluation. In this chapter, we go one step further and want to measure and evaluate the data from several satellites simultaneously. For this purpose, it is advisable to convert the program code developed so far into a form that allows concurrent or parallel evaluation of several satellites by using object-oriented programming. It should be noted that GPS tracking is particularly well suited to parallel data processing, as the evaluations of the satellite data are completely independent of each other and only need to be merged for the subsequent positioning.\n",

The other classes are instantiated within *SatStream()* and *SatOrbit()*. They have already been discussed in the chapter *[Data decoding](#Data-decoding)*, but are briefly described again here for the sake of completeness. The code for the classes can be found in the *gpslib* module. \n",

    "\n",
    "- *demodDoppler()*: The signal is demodulated using the measured Doppler frequency and phase offset.\n",
    "- *cacodeCorr()*: The demodulated data is correlated with the CA code of the satellite in question. As a result, the maximum correlation amplitude and the code phase are determined.\n",
    "- *decodeData()*: The BPSK signal is obtained by multiplying the demodulated data with phase-matched CA code and subsequent averaging. The signal-to-noise ratio of the amplitude is determined for information purposes. If phase-locked, sample time and satellite time of edge signals (phase inversion) are saved in a list.\n",
    "- *phaseLockedLoop()*: The phase of the demodulated signal is calculated as a function of time using the real and imaginary parts. It is used to continuously correct and improve the Doppler frequency and phase offset with the aim of minimizing the imaginary part (Q) in the demodulation process (phase locking). If successful a sequence of analog binary pulses of varying length appears in the real part (I).\n",
    "- *evalEdges()*: The list of edge signals is evaluated and converted into bits. When the data array is sufficiently long, the bits are checked and decoded using the *Subframe()* class. The subframes mainly contain information about the current GPS time and the satellite's elliptical orbit.\n",
    "- *sweepFrequency()*: This routine is only executed if the quality of the correlation signal from *cacodeCorr()* is insufficient over a longer period of time (currently $60\\,\\rm s$). The Doppler frequency is then newly measured by a scan of the entire frequency range (50 different frequencies with *STEP_FREQ=200*). In order not to exceed the cycle time of the data streams (currently $32\\,\\rm ms$), this is done by several calls of *SatStream()*.

    "#### Multiprocessing - parallel data processing \n",
    "\n",
    "The processors of today's computers are generally equipped with several cores that can process data almost independently of each other. In many cases, however, a program cannot use this computer power at all, as the program has to divide its tasks and calculations into different, largely independent processes. This applies in particular to normal Python scripts, as the memory management of *CPython* allows *MultiThreading* with *concurrent* routines, but does not permit parallel processing (*GIL*, Global Interpreter Lock). Therefore, a script running in an instance of a Python interpreter can only ever use one processor core. A loophole is to start several Python interpreters, each with its own script and process, and have them communicate with each other. Such a procedure for GPS tracking is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel data processing is particularly useful when the data to be processed is largely independent of each other. This is actually the case for the processing of the *satStream()* instances, which take up a significant part of the computing time during positioning, so that multiprocessing can be used to great advantage. The *multiprocessing* module is used for this purpose. However, the previous embedding of the program in a *Jupyter notebook* must be partially replaced, as *multiprocessing* is not compatible with *JupyterLab*. The time-parallel processes are each started in a separate Python environment. This can be done using two different methods, *forking* or *spawning*, of which the *spawn* process is used here as it is supported by both Windows and Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far data reception, decoding and positioning have all been done together in a Jupyter notebook. This is now changed by splitting off parts of the data processing. While position fixing can be still processed in a Jupyter notebook to make further use of the interactive graphical user interface,  data reception and decoding is now carried out in a Python script using multiprocessing (*gpsrecv.py*). The multiprocessing module is imported in the script as *mp* and the *Process()* class is used for creating separated processes. If *runProc()* is the function to be executed in the new process and *(inQ,outQ,)* are its arguments, then an instance of *Process()* is created and initialized by\n",
    "\n",
    "        satProc = mp.Process(target=runProc,args=(inQ,outQ,))\n",
    "\n",
    "The target function *runProc()* is then executed by *satProc.start()*. For our purposes, this function consists of an infinite loop that receives commands via the input *Queue* (inQ) and executes them within the new process. The result is sent back to the main program (*parent process*) using the output queue (outQ). Usually the main program is already waiting for it using the (blocking) function *outQ.get()*. In such a way, separate processes are employed for all observed satellites. In each of these processes a *satStream()* instance is created and performs demodulation and decoding of the data passed to it via the input queue. The processes are executed in parallel and can use all cores of the processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fixing the position the collected *satStream()* results are forwarded to the Jupyter notebook once per second by means of a network transfer using the *connectionless* network protocol UDP. Compared to the TCP protocol, the sender does not expect an acknowledgement of receipt, so that the UDP transfer is potentially faster. The actual sending process takes place independently of the processor with its own hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the Python script and the Jupyter notebook are running on the same computer, transfer is simply done via the local IP address 127.0.0.0 (*localhost*). However, if the computer is used already at the limit of its capacity, a remote computer can also take over the evaluation. Finally, at the end of navigation, all parallel *mp* processes are closed using *satProc.join()* and *satProc.close()*. In the Python script *gpsrecv.py*, the above steps are carried out with the functions *initMultiProcPool()*, *initPoolStreams()*, *delPoolStreams()* and *closeMultiProcPool()*. In addition, they also enable the processes to be deleted or replaced, e.g., if a satellite has only weak signals or disappeared already below the horizon. The process management, however, is always done in such a way that the initially defined maximum number of satellites *MAX_SAT* is not exceeded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the new program structure, a total of *MAX_SAT + 2* Python processes are usually created and executed in parallel. This includes the process of the main program *gpsrecv.py* as well as the process for the Jupyter notebook if the position evaluation is carried out locally. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that reading the RTL-SDR data via the USB interface at a rate of 4 MByte/s represents an additional system load. All these processes are allocated to the available processor cores in an optimized manner by the operating system's scheduler. Program execution is therefore particularly effective if the number of processor cores is similar or greater than MAX_SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified version of multiprocessing with several *satStream()* instances can be found in the following example. The global variable *MAX_SAT* is used to define the number of satellites and thus the number of processes. After creating the processes with *initMultiProcPool()*, they are initialized for different satellites (i.e. different CA codes) by *initPoolStreams()*. Then (randomized) data is passed to the instances for calculation using *Queue*. The results, including the calculation time, are then displayed on the screen. The dependency of the execution time on the number of satellites can be determined by selecting different *MAX_SAT*. "

    "- the available computing power must be shared with the system processes running in the background. The administrative effort (e.g. *scheduling*) increases with the number of processes.\n",
    "- the slowest of the parallel processes determines the total time. If, for example, an important system process is started on one of the cores with high priority, this delays the total time of the multiprocessing by its duration. The more time multiprocessing takes, the more likely such delays become. The required computing time therefore increases *non-linearly* with the number of satellites.\n",

If this is not achieved despite the buffer memory being set up, data streams must be discarded. If this happens more than once per 6-second subframe, the data contained in the stream can no longer be read. It is even more problematic if data is already overwritten in the device driver. If the absence of the overwritten streams is not detected, only incorrect positions are subsequently calculated, as the sample time can no longer be calculated due to the unknown number of overwritten streams. A suitable method for error detection is described in the chapter *[Real-time Positioning](#Real-time-positioning)*."

    "#### Which satellites are available? - Frequency sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, for the sake of simplicity, it has been assumed that the satellites currently 'visible' in the sky are known. However, in order to be independent of other sources of information, it makes sense to determine these satellites yourself using a measurement. To do this, the entire range of Doppler frequencies from $-5000\\,\\rm Hz$ to $+5000\\,\\rm Hz$ must be scanned for GPS signals. Tests showed that a relatively rough step width of $200\\,\\rm Hz$ between the individual frequencies is sufficient for finding a satellite, so that a total of $31\\cdot 50 = 1550$ correlation calculations of a data stream with the various CA codes of the satellites are necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding of the computational effort required, the correlation calculation as performed in *satStream()* is briefly recapitulated: the method used is based on three Fourier transformations (FT) of a data length of 2048 samples each: the FT of the C/A code, the FT of the data and the reverse transformation of their product (see Appendix, *[Cross correlation using Fourier transforms](#Cross-correlation-using-Fourier-transforms)*). However, the FTs of the 31 C/A codes only need to be calculated once at the beginning of the program. The FT of the data is done for 8 consecutive data blocks ($\\rm CORR\\_AVG=8$) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This means that 9 FTs are normally required per correlation and therefore $1550\\cdot 9=13950$ FT calculations for all satellites and frequencies. However, some significant optimizations are possible for the simultaneous frequency sweep of all satellites: 1) averaging the data over 4 blocks is sufficient for the sweep ($\\rm CORR\\_AVG=4$) and b) the FT of the data demodulated at a given Doppler frequency can be used for all 31 satellites. This reduces the total effort by a factor of 8 to $50\\cdot(31 + {\\rm CORR\\_AVG}) = 1750$ FTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first search for satellites is carried out before starting GPS tracking. For a longer measurement, however, it is also useful to search for new satellites at regular intervals, especially if the signal from a satellite becomes too weak or has already disappeared completely. It is then necessary to perform the sweep in such a way that the data streams continuously read by the RTL-SDR can continue to be transferred to the local data buffer without interruption. With the currently used value $\\rm N\\_CYC=32$, this means that the sweep must be interrupted briefly after $32\\,\\rm ms$ at the latest. In the Python code, this is realized by passing the parameter $\\rm IT\\_SWEEP\\_ALL$ to the function *sweepAllSats()*. This specifies how many different Doppler frequencies are tested for all 31 satellites per call. Its number depends on the computer used and should be determined once before using the programs. With a value of $\\rm IT\\_SWEEP\\_ALL=10$, a complete frequency sweep with $50$ different frequencies requires a total time of $50/10\\cdot 32\\,\\rm ms = 0.16\\,\\rm s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following script is used to determine the available satellites with their current Doppler frequencies. It can be used to determine the optimum parameter $\\rm IT\\_SWEEP\\_ALL$ for a computer. By setting $\\rm LIVE\\_MEAS=False$, stored measurement data can also be used for this purpose."

    "1. *Phase tracking*\n",
    "\n",
    "    The tracking of Doppler frequency and phase using a *phase-locked loop* was described in detail in the chapter [Data reception](#Data-reception) for stationary receivers. In particular, it was found that the maximum frequency shift per second is around $1\\,\\rm Hz/s$. The frequency shift is a result of the acceleration of the satellite relative to the receiver and is limited to around $0.1\\,\\rm m/s^2$ (see plot in [Satellite orbits and positions](#Satellite-orbits-and-positions)). However, when tracking a non-stationary receiver (e.g. in a vehicle), the total acceleration between satellite and receiver can be much larger. Even if you pick up the RTL-SDR stick and move it by one meter within one second, the average acceleration is already $2\\,\\rm m/s^2$. You can observe the effect on the control loop yourself using the notebook *E21_SatData_Live_1*. The control parameters and the control frequency (32 Hz) are often too small to follow the rapid frequency and phase changes. When the receiver is accelerated significantly, it is therefore inevitable that the phase is temporarily lost and the subframe data can no longer be decoded. It is then important that the control loop quickly restores the locked state as soon as the acceleration decreases. However, the algorithm used so far leads sometimes to unpredictable frequency corrections $\\Delta f$ as it is designed for relatively small phase changes. In a new approach the rapid changes of the phase should have a far less influence. This can be achieved by using for $\\Delta f$ mainly the *averaged frequency change* $\\overline{\\Delta f}$ of the past second (32 cycles, *DF_NO*=32) and adding only a comparatively small correction based on the measured phase changes (see [Phase Locked Loop](#Phase-Locked-Loop)),\n",
    "   $$\\Delta f = \\overline{\\Delta f} + g\\cdot \\overline {\\Delta\\phi}$$\n",
    "   Furthermore, the maximum amount of frequency change per second *DF_MAX* is limited to $20\\,\\rm Hz$. This prevents rapid drifting away from the actual Doppler frequency if the satellite signal temporarily fails completely, e.g. when the vehicle drives through a long tunnel. A smaller value for *DF_MAX*, on the other hand, would have the disadvantage that the correct Doppler frequency would be set with a greater delay at the start of the measurement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. *Frequency sweep*\n",
    "\n",
    "   Despite the improvements in the algorithm for *phase tracking*, the Doppler frequency of the satellite may be lost due to a low or failing signal. Such a failure is detected using the quality of the correlation amplitude for the code phase (*cpQ*) measured with each cycle. If this averaged value is below zero over a longer period of time (1 min), a frequency sweep is automatically triggered in the associated *satStream()* instance to find the Doppler frequency again. In this way, the satellite is often \"rediscovered\" if it was previously not visible for a longer period of time, e.g. due to large buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving the results**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the measurement has been completed, the data serialized using *pickle* can also be saved to the hard disk. To do this, set the global variable *SAVE_PICKLE=True*.

If successful, the returned result for each transmission time is the average receiver position in ECEF coordinates, the respective propagation times of the satellite signals and the uncertainty for the least-squares fit (*residuals*). A calculated position is only considered valid if the uncertainty is below a specified threshold (*MAX_RESIDUAL*). Otherwise, it is added to an error list (*lsfFailLst*) whose number of entries is displayed in the user interface. In addition to a list *recPosLst* of time-dependent receiver positions, a list *satPosLst* of time-dependent satellite positions is generated, which is later used to show the satellite positions in a polar diagram.\n",

    "As an example, the screenshot shows the displayed information of a real-time GPS tracking during a car journey in Karlsruhe, Germany (left window). The maximum number of satellites was set to *MAX_SAT=10*. Of the 10 satellites found, 7 are active, i.e. their ephemerides have been successfully read (\"Ok\") and they regularly contribute to the position fixing (\"*\"). The ephemerides for the remaining satellites are not yet complete, as satellites PRN02 and PRN28 have only just been found in a frequency sweep and satellite PRN11 has too weak a signal. The insufficient signal amplitude is due to a position low on the horizon (altitude 3°), which can be checked retrospectively on the website [In-the-Sky](https://in-the-sky.org/satmap_radar.php), for example. The signal strengths given for amplitude and correlation refer to their mean noise amplitude (rms) and are therefore a direct measure of the signal-to-noise ratio. The figures for TOW and ID show whether a subframe was decoded in the passed 6 seconds. Even if this is not the case for a satellite, it usually still contributes to the position fixing, as the code phase measurement is much less critical as compared to subframe reading. However, the prerequisite for this is that the ephemeris has already been read in (subframes 1, 2 and 3). The track of the measured GPS coordinates (averaged over 1 second) is shown in the plot and is updated every second. If required, a second track of all measuring points can also be displayed. The spatial distribution of all measured positions gives a good impression of the current *Dilution of Precision* (DOP). \n",

This is a simple way of checking the quality of the positioning - the example shown is reasonably representative of this. The track is usually located directly on or very close to the road with standard deviations of the mean value of typically 1-5 meters. Larger deviations are obtained when the number of active satellites falls below 6. Better results are achieved with 10 or more satellites. Since the signal propagation delays in the atmosphere is not accounted for when fixing the positions, systematic deviations sometimes occur which in rare cases can be greater than 10 m.\n",

It turned out that on the same computer, live tracking on Linux can be done with a maximum of 11 satellites, but on Windows only with 7 at best. In addition, there are usually quite a few *code phase* errors on Windows, whereas on Linux there are usually none. Therefore, if you are a Windows user and do not have a Linux computer, but would like to use the GPS tracking software with more satellites, you can try this out relatively easily in a WSL environment.\n",

It is recommended to choose the latest possible *ubuntu* distribution instead of the standard distribution. It should also be noted that the subsystem version *WSL 2* is set. A special feature compared to normal Linux installations is that direct access to the USB interface with the *RTL-SDR* is initially not possible. This is of course under the control of Windows and must therefore be transferred to the subsystem in a suitable manner. This is done with the open source software [usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win). Instructions for installation and use can be found at [Connect USB devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb).

It is possible to set the Windows browser as the default browser using the utility [wslu](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu?tab=readme-ov-file), but the execution of the call is then relatively slow (at least for the first one). As an alternative, an attempt was made to start the time-critical script for data acquisition under WSL-Linux and to run the script for evaluation on Windows. However, this failed because apparently no UDP connection is possible between the systems. Perhaps communication would succeed via a TCP connection, but this was not attempted."

    "\n",
    "If we assume that the data is already digitized and available as complex numbers $\\mathfrak E(t)$, the removal (demodulation) of the known carrier frequency $f$ with $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is simply achieved by multiplying by ${\\rm e}^{-i\\omega t}$ (see [Complex numbers](#Complex-numbers)),\n",

    "Please note that due to the unknown phase $\\phi$, the (usually time-dependent) information $A$ is still distributed over both \"data channels\" $I$ and $Q$.$^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following it is briefly described how the data $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are generated from an analog signal $E(t)$ in a radio receiver. Here the carrier frequency $f \\ge 100\\,\\rm MHz$ is too high for a direct *analog-to-digital conversion* (ADC) so that analog electronics have to be used for the demodulation. Without knowing the phase $\\phi$ of the oscillation the real amplitude of the signal with angular frequency $\\omega$ can be represented by the formula $E(t) = I\\cos\\omega t - Q\\sin\\omega t$ (see [Complex numbers](#Complex-numbers)). To obtain $I$ and $Q$, the signal $E(t)$ is processed in two separate channels. In the first channel, an oscillator generates an oscillation $\\cos\\omega t$ (analog) which is then multiplied with $E(t)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(t)\\cdot\\cos\\omega t = I\\,\\cos^2\\omega t - Q\\,\\sin\\omega t\\cdot\\cos\\omega t = \\frac I 2\\,\\bigl(1+\\cos 2\\omega t\\bigr) - \\frac Q 2\\,\\sin2\\omega t \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is then sent through a *low-pass filter* with cut-off frequency $\\omega_0 < \\omega$. This leaves only $I/2$ at the output of the low-pass filter. Note that $I = I(t)$ can still contain frequencies lower than $\\omega_0$. The same is done in the second channel for the extraction of $Q$, except that the cosine oscillation is delayed by $90^\\circ$ beforehand, so that $E(t)$ is multplied with $-\\sin\\omega t$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(t)\\cdot(-\\sin\\omega t) = - I\\,\\sin\\omega t\\cdot\\cos\\omega t + Q\\,\\sin^2\\omega t = - \\frac I 2\\,\\sin2\\omega t + \\frac Q 2\\,\\bigl(1-\\cos 2\\omega t\\bigr) \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "After the low-pass filtering, only $Q(t)/2$ with frequencies less than $\\omega_0$ remain. In an *RTL-SDR* the analog signals $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are then digitized separately, further processed (filtering, downsampling, etc.) and finally sent to the USB interface as a stream of numbers $(I_n,Q_n)$.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Cross correlation using Fourier transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-correlation for complex numbers is defined as an integral\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f\\star g = \\int f^\\ast(t) g(t+\\tau)\\,{\\rm d}t , $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which corresponds to the summation expression for discrete data. There is an alternative way for the calculation, which is often used because of its better efficiency in many cases. \n",
    "This is based on the *Fourier transform* $F(\\omega)$ with angular frequency $\\omega$ of a time-dependent function $f(t)$. This is defined for complex functions $f(t)$ by (without taking prefactors into account)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(\\omega) = \\int f(t)\\,{\\rm e}^{i\\omega t}\\,{\\rm d}t \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The original function $f(t)$ can be recovered from this using the *inverse Fourier transform* (without prefactors)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(t) = \\int F(\\omega)\\,{\\rm e}^{-i\\omega t}\\,{\\rm d}\\omega \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the same relationships also apply to $g(t)$ and $G(\\omega)$, then the correlation function of $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ can be calculated using the *cross-correlation theorem*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f\\star g = \\mathfrak{F}^{-1}\\Big\\{F^\\ast(\\omega)\\cdot G(\\omega)\\Big\\} \\ , $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathfrak{F}^{-1}$ is the application of the inverse Fourier transform. The correlation for all possible shifts $\\tau$ is therefore calculated using three Fourier transforms.\n",
    "This calculation method can be particularly advantageous when using the so-called *Fast Fourier Transform* (FFT) for numerical tasks. However, the data lengths for $f$ and $g$ must then be the same and powers of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard routines from the *numpy* or *scipy* modules are used to calculate the Fourier transforms. As the C/A codes do not have a length with a power of two, they are brought to a length of 2048 by interpolation, as this is required when using the *RTL-SDR*. In contrast to the previous correlation calculation, it should be noted that the correlation result is an array of complex numbers. If $f$ and $g$ are both real, then the imaginary part of the result is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script calculates a similar correlation as at the beginning of the tutorial to illustrate this. The *GPSCacodeRep* function from the *gpslib* module calculates the interpolated C/A codes. The blue curves show the real part, the orange curves the imaginary part."

    "The concept of a *Software Defined Radio* for the use of GPS tracking is both simple and challenging. The subject is rich in interesting topics at the interface of mathematics, physics and digital signal processing. It quickly became apparent, however, that there is a large gap between the wealth of general information on these topics and the scarce availability of useful advice regarding the coding of a GPS tracking software.$^1$ So the idea was born to narrow this gap a little with this tutorial. \n",

    "The author is an experimental physicist and lecturer at a university. He started this project in his spare time out of curiosity and fun of coding. It is his first venture into coding with Python, so he asks for your indulgence if the code does not always conform to a *pythonic* style. Unless otherwise stated, the algorithms employed were developed by the author himself. This applies in particular to the code for data reception and the extraction of the reception time from the code phases. It is therefore possible that procedures have been used in the code that deviate from standard practice and may be improved. The author would be grateful for any comments.\n",
